# set -e that teardown crash aborts the whole gate before ruff/pyright/tests. So gate on
# the VERDICT, not the exit code: capture the output, accept the run when uv-secure
# reported all-safe (even if it then crashed), but still FAIL on a real finding (no
# all-safe line) so a genuine CVE is never masked, and fail loud if it never got a
# verdict at all (so a broken run is never silently skipped).
